    m_Localized: 'I finally broke out of prison. The guards are right behind me,
      I need to keep moving.


      I still have that little gadget I stole from
      that weird visitor, thief''s habits, I couldn''t help it when we crossed paths.


      It
      seems to be running low on energy, the screen shows one minute left, and more
      importantly, one life left.


      Even though going back in time instead
      of dying has its perks, the feeling of your body desintegrating is... uncomfortable.


      My
      nose itches again, maybe it merged with my mouth ? I''d rather keep my mask
      on and not look.'

    m_Localized: 'There, the device is charged up. It seems entering this tower synchronised
      it with something.



      Whenever I enter a new room, the parameters reset,
      maybe there are more gadgets like this one scattered around ?



      Anyway,
      I can make mistakes again, but with less time available. I must go forward,
      at once.



      I hope I can find someone that will get this device out of
      me.'

      just for me, or rather, for this damn device.



      Is someone watching
      me ? Is this a test ? There is no time to stop and wonder.



      My successive
      deaths are really starting to get on my nerves, like this itching nose, or
      this mouth.



      Anyway, there is no turning back now, so let''s press
      forward.'

      I could die in this tower, but this god-damn device won't let me.\r\n\r\nI
      recognized some drawings on the walls, and the cogs scattered around are the
      same as on the device.\r\n\r\nThis tower was made by the same creator, for
      sure. The man I stole from before breaking out of prison, for sure. He is using
      me like a lab rat for his tests, for sure.\r\n\r\nFocus, Mark, you just have
      to get out of here, and all will be weel, for sure.\r"

      body. I can''t open my eyes. Actually, I can no longer feel my whole face,
      as if it was gone.



      Even though I can''t see the device''s parameters,
      I have a feeling there is little time left, and few lives left.



      I
      feel the wind''s gentle touch, and sun''s warm embrace. What an odd feeling.'
