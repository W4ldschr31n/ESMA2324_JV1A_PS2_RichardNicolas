    m_Localized: Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together
      in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the
      Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed
      him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered
      the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. And although his airbending skills
      are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe
      Aang can save the world.

    m_Localized: "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\r\nOver
      many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore\u2014\r\n    While I nodded,
      nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\r\nAs of some one gently rapping,
      rapping at my chamber door.\r\n\u201C\u2019Tis some visitor,\u201D I muttered,
      \u201Ctapping at my chamber door\u2014\r\n            Only this and nothing
      more.\u201D"
